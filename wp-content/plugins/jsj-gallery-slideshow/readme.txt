JSJ Gallery Slideshow is a  Wordpress plugin that substitutes the default gallery an turns into a much nicer slideshow. 

== Description ==

JSJ Gallery Slideshow is a Wordpress plugin that substitutes the default gallery an turns into a much nicer slideshow. It does this completely automatically (really, it’s that easy!). You only have to install the plugin and all your slideshows will be automatically converted to something like [this](http://thejsj.com/#/uncategorized/jsj-%C2%B7-gallery-slideshow-example/).

You can change almost all the options allowed by [Jquery Cycle](http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/options.html) (it’s based on this Jquery plugin) such as: transition time, transition effect, timeout between transition (or no timeout), slide class, …etc.

This plugin is inspired by [Cargo Collective’s slideshow feature](http://cargocollective.com/slideshow) and uses [Jquery Cycle](http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/) and [Jquery Easing](http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/) as the basis for the plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire jsjGallerySlideshow folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress. At that moment, all your slideshows will be automatically converted into JSJ gallery / slidshows.
3. Optional: If you want to change any of the options for the plugin, go to Settings -> JSJ · Gallery & Slideshow.

== Frequently asked questions ==
